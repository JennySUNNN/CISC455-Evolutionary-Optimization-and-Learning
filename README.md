# CISC455-Project
The goal of this project (solo) is to exercise on implementing an evolutionary algorithm to solve application problems following the workflow:
1. Identify an application problem
University Class Scheduing Problem
2. Determine if EA is a good candidate solver
It is a good solver, because this problem 
3. Design an EA for the application problem
4. Implement your EA
5. Compare your EA performance to at least one other alternative algorithm
6. Discuss your results

Milestones:
Final project report and code (due on December 13th)

The maximum 10-page final project report (excluding references) should follow the structure of 
Problem description - EA design - EA results - Comparison - Discussion. 
Please use Latex and submit your final .pdf file.
All source code must be submitted as well with a readme.txt to describe the implementation. 
Your EA should be implemented from scratch. 
The implementation of the alternative algorithm(s) can use libraries or packages. 
This should be described in your written report.
